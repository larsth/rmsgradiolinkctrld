package gpsd

//DEVICE is the request and response type from a "?DEVICE" command.
//
//If CommandDEVICE is followed by a ';' the state of a device, or sets
//(when followed by '=' and a DEVICE object) device-specific control bits,
// notably the device's speed and serial mode and the native-mode bit.
//The parameter-setting form (a request) will be rejected if more than
//one client is attached to the channel.
//
//Pay attention to the response, because it is possible for this command
//to fail if the GPS does not support a speed-switching command or only
//supports some combinations of serial modes. In case of failure, the
//daemon and GPS will continue to communicate at the old speed.
//
//Use the parameter-setting form with caution. On USB and Bluetooth GPSes
//it is also possible for serial mode setting to fail either because the
//serial adaptor chip does not support non-8N1 modes or because the device
//firmware does not properly synchronize the serial adaptor chip with the
//UART on the GPS chipset when the speed changes.
//These failures can hang your device, possibly requiring a GPS power cycle
//or (in extreme cases) physically disconnecting the NVRAM backup battery.
//
//The serial parameters will be omitted in a response describing a TCP/IP
//source such as an Ntrip, DGPSIP, or AIS feed.
//
//The gpsd daemon occasionally ships a bare DEVICE object to the client
//(that is, one not inside a DEVICES wrapper).
