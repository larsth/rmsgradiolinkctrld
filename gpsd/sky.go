//SKY is a type used to report a sky view of the GPS satellite positions.
//
//If there is no GPS device available, or no skyview has been reported yet,
//only the "class" field will reliably be present.
//
//Many devices compute dilution of precision factors but do not include them in
//their reports. Many that do report DOPs report only HDOP, two-dimensional
//circular error.
//gpsd always passes through whatever the device actually reports, then attempts
//to fill in other DOPs by calculating the appropriate determinants in a
//covariance matrix based on the satellite view.
//DOPs may be missing if some of these determinants are singular.
//It can even happen that the device reports an error estimate in meters when the
//corresponding DOP is unavailable; some devices use more sophisticated error
//modeling than the covariance calculation.
