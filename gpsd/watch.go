package gpsd

//WATCH is type used both for a "?WATCH" command
//request and the response from that command.
//
//A WATCH command (CommandWATCH) sets the watcher mode.
//In watcher mode, the gpsd daemon reports are dumped as TPV and SKY
//responses.
//
//A WATCH request changes the subscriber's policy.
//A WATCH request also sets or elicits a report of per-subscriber
//policy and the raw bit.
//
//A WATCH response describes the subscriber's policy, and will also
//include a DEVICES object.
//
// Undocumented struct field
//
//There is an additional boolean "timing" struct field which is
//undocumented because that portion of the interface is considered
//unstable and for (gpsd-)developers use only.
//
//Struct field "Timing" is not implemented in this Go library.
